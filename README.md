While reading Barack Obama's autobiography, I came across a wonderful quote from his wife. I find the words so inspiring and wanted to somehow honor them.

That's how these wallpapers came to be. It's the first time I've created wallpapers using Affinity Designer 2. It's also the first time I've created vector graphics myself. I've learned a lot in the process.

Perhaps others will also find them enjoyable.
