# sunset wallpaper
You know, it always fascinates me how the sky changes colors depending on how dust, pollution, water droplets and the clouds form in the sky. Lately, I've noticed that pinks and purples show up more often than the usual reds and oranges. I did some research and found out that this is partly due to an optical illusion when the pink wavelengths illuminate the base of the clouds. This creates beautiful pink clouds that stand out against a deep blue sky. And this combination of pink and dark blue then often gives the sky that stunning deep purple glow. All these thoughts finally inspired me to create this cool wallpaper. It's just fascinating how nature surprises us again and again with such amazing impressions, isn't it?
